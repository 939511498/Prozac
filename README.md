<h1 align="center">Prozac üíä</h1>

Prozac is an advanced color-based aimbot and triggerbot for Valorant, made for educational purposes.

## üõ† Requirements

To get started with Prozac, you will need **one** of the following Arduino boards:

- [Arduino Leonardo](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-leonardo-with-headers?selectedStore=us) `Recommened`
- [Arduino Micro](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-micro?selectedStore=us)

For a version without an Arduino board required, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/bsNKqvxvE2).

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Setup the Arduino
1. Download and install [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe) as it is the most compatible version for Prozac.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `prozacsetup.py`. This script will guide you through configuring your Arduino for Prozac. Ensure you select the appropriate options.
4. Once the setup is complete, you're ready to run `main.py`.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, watch this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/pPDarnIaIG4).

### Customizing Prozac
1. To tweak Prozac settings to your preference, refer to the [prozac.py](https://github.com/Primoria/Prozac/blob/main/prozac.py#L13-L23) file. The configuration options are provided at the top.
2. Experiment with the settings to find what works best for you; remember, there's nothing called "best settings."
3. Before using this source code, it's recommended to make some edits. Without changes, it might become detectable in the future. More details are available on our [Discord server](discord.gg/bsNKqvxvE2).
